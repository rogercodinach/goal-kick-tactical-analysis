# Results & Visualizations

This section summarizes the main findings from the analysis of Bayer Leverkusen's goal kicks in the **Training to Game Transfer** project. 

## Key Results

The project successfully achieved its objectives of analyzing and evaluating goal kicks using a quantitative tactical scoring system. The main outcomes include:

- **Automated detection of goal kicks** and extraction of contextual data, allowing a structured evaluation of each action.
- **Tactical scoring system**: Each goal kick is scored according to predefined tactical criteria, providing insights into execution quality and alignment with team strategy.
- **Influence of player positioning**: Higher density of teammates near the goal kick correlates with higher tactical scores.
- **Effect of game rhythm and match context**: Slower rhythms and lower pressure situations tend to produce more effective goal kicks.
- **Continuity of performance**: Goalkeepers with high-scoring previous kicks are more likely to maintain good tactical execution in subsequent actions.

These results highlight patterns that can inform tactical decisions and improve goal kick effectiveness.

## Visualizations

Currently, two visualizations are available in this repository:

1. **Player positions near goal kick execution**
   - Shows the spatial arrangement of players at the moment of the goal kick.

2. **Relationship between nearby teammates and goal kick score**
   - Illustrates how teammate proximity affects tactical score, confirming the importance of team structure for effective execution.
